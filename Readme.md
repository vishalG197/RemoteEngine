Multiple User Base System for Clients and Developers
Introduction
This project aims to develop a web application that facilitates the registration and onboarding process for both clients (companies) and developers. The system utilizes Node.js for the backend, React for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage. The application provides secure sign-up APIs, employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, and features an extensive onboarding process for developers.

Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine.
MongoDB installed and running.
Git repository created for the project.
Task
Implement a user-friendly web application that allows clients and developers to register, authenticate, and complete the onboarding process. Ensure secure communication, utilize JWT for authentication, and follow best practices for code quality.

Features
User Registration:
Clients and developers can register using their email addresses.
Authentication:
Secure all APIs (except sign-up) using JWT for secure communication.
Developer Onboarding:
Developers can submit detailed onboarding information, including personal details, skills, professional experiences, and educational experiences.
Multiple Education and Professional Experiences:
Developers can add multiple education details and professional experiences, associating each with relevant skills.
Predefined Skill Schema:
A predefined skill schema fetches skills from the backend, associating user skills and professional experiences with it.
References between Skills and Professional Experiences:
Establish references between users and predefined skills, ensuring each professional experience includes a reference to the skills used.
Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js
Frontend: React
Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
Documentation:
Comprehensive documentation on setting up and running the application.
Instructions on API endpoints, payload structures, and other relevant information.
Technologies Used
Node.js
React
MongoDB (Mongoose)
JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
Setup Backend:

bash
Copy code
cd your-project/backend
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
Run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Setup Frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd your-project/frontend
npm install
Run the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the application in your browser:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:5000
Edge Cases and Considerations
Ensure that the MongoDB database is running and accessible.
Handle cases where user input is incorrect or incomplete during registration and onboarding.
Implement proper error handling and validation throughout the application.
